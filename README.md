# Brick-shrinkage
* In this project I aim to process the data during drying of a brick clay tile in ambient conditions.
* The data consist of total mass of the tile over the course of the experiment as well as optical data to characterize local shrinkage behavior.
* Furthermore, for the same brick clay mass pore size distribution (PSD) at various stages of drying is measured.
* The PSD data are then analyzed to confirm the findings of the previous experiment.
* The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a mathematical model for simulation of drying brick clay tiles.
* Various data which are obtained from similar measurements will be fed to this model in the form of physical parameters.
